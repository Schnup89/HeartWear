# HeartWear - Broadcast your HearRate to the Network with UDP-Packets


First of all, many thanks to https://github.com/Domi2803 for the WearOS OBS Version!  
I've changed to code to send the Heart-Rate-Data via UDP-Network packets to a specified host.  
  
  
Changes:    
Removed - Cloud Data Firebase/Google  
Added - Server Host Settings and UDP Packet generator  
Added - Exit Button  
Added - Background-Service Indicator on Watch-Face
